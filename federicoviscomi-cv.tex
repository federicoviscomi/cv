  \begin{rSection}{Summary}
    I have an MSc computer science degree with full marks and honours, 
    a fair amount of experience with agile software development working at the core business of world class employers
    and I am passionate about experimenting and learning new technologies.


    %I believe in a compassionate sharing of ideas 


    % I am a passionate software engineer with a strong background in computer science.
    % It has been more than one year at the time of writing since I started working as
    % Android application and system developer on software that is part of the 
    % core business of the security team of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a corporation
    % that has a reputation of strong technical capabilities and it is a world leader in the mobile ecosystem.
    % Before that I can claim a six months experience as full stack web developer working for a word class employer (eBay).
    % I consider the switch from full stack web developer to Android application and system developer, that
    % happened in a short period of time, to be a proof of adaptability flexibility and openness
    % to changes and new technologies.
    % I had the opportunity to build a good understanding of computer science during my studies 
    % that led me to obtain a master degree in computer science with
    % full marks and honors at one of the best university in Italy.
    % add my high school somehow? here? in the education section?
    % 
    % add how I wrote my first simple c program at 12 with kernighan and ritchie

      %\begin{description}
	\item[Summary]
	  I was a member of the cryptography and security team and I have contributed to designing writing testing and reviewing the following kinds of software:
	  Android applications for showcasing services and libraries to our b2b customers,
	  Android services, 
	  Java and JNI libraries, 
	  C/C++ libraries such as PKCS11 compliant cryptographic libraries,
	  C/C++ system daemons,
	  trusted applications for Qualcomm's TrustZone based real time operating system,
	  C libraries at the kernel level,
	  python programs for manipulation of binary files and for collecting analysing and visualising data

	  Not only have I taken part in the realization of new projects but I have contributed to exiting projects with a large code base as well.

	  On the people management side I was responsible for getting up to speed a new hire
	  
	  
	\item[Example]
	  One of my tangible contributions to the company during my stay are in the Sharp AQUOS ZETA SH-03G.
	  It is a smartphone using Qualcomm MSM8994 chipset and running Android 5.0 Lollipop. 
	  The device is equipped with a biometric authentication sensor, specifically
	  Qualcomm's 3D fingerprint technology.
	  I contributed by writing some software, i.e. a Java service, a Java library and a JNI library
	  that are integrated in the Qualcomm Snapdragon Sense ID biometrics platform and they
	  are part of an authentication and mobile payment service offered by DOCOMO (Japan's predominant mobile operator).
	  The platform can integrate as well with third-party biometric sensors and it is a certified
	  implementation of the FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) protocol.

	  \item[Summary]  
	    I was an intern at eBay and I was working as a web developer using a test driven delopment process. 
	    We used HTML5, JavaScript and AngularJS for the front-end. 
	    The back-end used Java or Scala with the Play framework and was backed by a MySQL database or a MongoDB. 
	    TODO add REST API? or REST full?
	    Other technologies we used are: 
	    	TestNG for testing the back-end; 
		Jenkins for continuous integration; 
		Gerrit for code review; 
	    	GIT as version control system; 
		maven or sbt for build automation;
		websocket for communication among front-end and back-end.	  
	  \item[Example]
	    I am particularly proud of a project called TweetMiner, 
	    I and two other interns started this project from scratch,
	    it is a web application that uses data mining, pattern recognition and sentiment analysis techniques on tweets to find out how people feel about eBay and the products they bought. 
	    %We wrote the back-end  in Scala, 
	    %the front-end in HTML5, JavaScript and AngularJS.
	    %We used TDD as development process.

      % TODO include a diffuse mode description of the project
	I built a deductive system for an extension of RDF with fuzzy logic under the supervision of a senior researcher Umberto Straccia.
	%The system is an implementation of the deductive system described in the paper 
	%''Umberto Straccia. A Minimal Deductive System for General Fuzzy RDF. Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems (RR-09), 2009.''
	The work I have done include:
	an implementation of a new language fuzzyRDF as a particular subset of RDF,
        a mechanisms of storage of RDF knowledge bases as XML files,
        a graphical and textual interface to the system,
	a proper configuration of the deductive rules of the Apache Jena reasoner,
        definition of the syntax of an apposite new query language: Fuzzy RDF Query language (FuRQL)
	and implementation in Java of a parser and a compiler from FuRQL to the SPARQL language \\
