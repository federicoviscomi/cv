		\item[\null]
			I was a member of the cryptography and security team and I have contributed to designing writing testing and reviewing the following kinds of software:
			Android applications for showcasing services and libraries to our b2b customers,
			Android services, 
			Java and JNI libraries, 
			C/C++ libraries such as PKCS11 compliant cryptographic libraries,
			C/C++ system daemons,
			trusted applications for Qualcomm's TrustZone based real time operating system,
			C libraries at the kernel level,
			Python programs for manipulation of binary files and for collecting analysing and visualising data.
			
			Not only have I taken part in the realization of new projects but I have contributed to exiting projects with a large code base as well.
			
			On the people management side I was responsible for getting up to speed a new hire

		\item[\null]
			I was an intern at eBay and I was working as a web developer using a test driven delopment process. 
			We used HTML5, JavaScript and AngularJS for the front-end. 
			The back-end used Java or Scala with the Play framework and was backed by a MySQL database or a MongoDB. 
			Other technologies we used are: 
			REST; TestNG for testing the back-end; 
			Jenkins for continuous integration; 
			Gerrit for code review; 
			GIT as version control system; 
			maven and sbt for build automation;
			websocket for communication among front-end and back-end.	  
	    
			I am particularly proud of a project called TweetMiner, 
			I and two other interns started this project from scratch,
			it is a web application that uses data mining, pattern recognition and sentiment analysis techniques on tweets to find out how people feel about eBay and the products they bought.

		\item[\null]
			I built a deductive system for an extension of RDF with fuzzy logic under the supervision of a senior researcher Umberto Straccia.
			The work I have done include:
			an implementation of a new language fuzzyRDF as a particular subset of RDF,
			a mechanisms of storage of RDF knowledge bases as XML files,
			a graphical and textual interface to the system,
			a proper configuration of the deductive rules of the Apache Jena reasoner,
			definition of the syntax of an apposite new query language: Fuzzy RDF Query language (FuRQL)
			and implementation in Java of a parser and a compiler from FuRQL to the SPARQL language \\
