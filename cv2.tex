    \begin{resume}

        \section{\textsc{Summary}}
        I have a good background in foundational topics of computer science
        and a fair amount of experience with agile software development working at the core business of world class employers.
        I like to see my self as kind, adaptable and open to changes.


        % I am a passionate software engineer with a strong background in computer science.
        % It has been more than one year at the time of writing since I started working as
        % Android application and system developer on software that is part of the
        % core business of the security team of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a corporation
        % that has a reputation of strong technical capabilities and it is a world leader in the mobile ecosystem.
        % Before that I can claim a six months experience as full stack web developer working for a word class employer (eBay).
        % I consider the switch from full stack web developer to Android application and system developer, that
        % happened in a short period of time, to be a proof of adaptability flexibility and openness
        % to changes and new technologies.
        % I had the opportunity to build a good understanding of computer science during my studies
        % that led me to obtain a master degree in computer science with
        % full marks and honors at one of the best university in Italy.
        % add my high school somehow? here? in the education section?
        %
        % add how I wrote my first simple c program at 12 with kernighan and ritchie
